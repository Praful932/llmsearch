        "A: Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells, which is 2 x 12 = 24 seashells. Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so he found 24 x 2 = 48 seashells. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, so Leigh had 48 / 3 = 16 seashells. The answer is 16.",
        "A: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Frankie has x number of cats.\n2. Frankie has x + 6 number of snakes.\n3. Frankie has x - 2 number of parrots.\n4. Frankie has 6 number of dogs.\n5. Frankie has 4 number of pets in 6 sets.\n\nNow we can use this information to find the total number of pets:\n\nFrom 1 and 2, we know that the number of cats and snakes differ by 6. So we can write the equation: x + (x + 6) = (x - 2) + (x + 6) + 6 = 2x + 6 - 2 = 2x + 4\n\nFrom 4, we know that 6 of the pets are dogs. Since there are 2 dogs, the total number of pets is 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the total number of pets is 8, and from the equation above, we can find the number of cats, which is x = (8 - 4) / 2 = 2.\n\nSo, Frankie has 2 cats, 2 + 6 = 8 snakes, 2 - 2 = 0 parrots, and 2 dogs. The answer is 8 pets in total.",
        "A: Olaf's collection started with 150 toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many as the uncle, so if the uncle gave Olaf x toy cars, then Grandpa gave Olaf 2x toy cars. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum, so Mum gave Olaf 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle, so the uncle gave Olaf x toy cars.\n\nNow, let's add up all the toy cars Olaf received: 150 (his original collection) + 2x (from Grandpa) + 10 (from Dad) + x (from Uncle) + 6 (from Auntie) + 15 (from Mum) = 150 + 2x + x + 6 + 15 = 186 + x.\n\nSince Auntie gave Olaf 1 more than the uncle, we know that x + 1 = 6, so x = 5.\n\nNow we can find out how many toy cars Olaf received in total: 186 + x = 186 + 5 = 191.\n\nThe answer is 191.",
        "A: At the start of the week, Emma has $100 in her account. Each day, she spends $8, so by the end of the week, she has spent $8 x 7 = $56. Her account then has $100 - $56 = $44 remaining. She asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give, which is $44 / $5 = $8.8 bills. Each $5 bill is worth $5, so she receives $8 x $5 = $40. The remaining amount in her account is $40.

        "A: First, we need to find the total width of the splashes for each type of rock.\n\nFor pebbles, TreQuan throws 6 of them, and each pebble makes a splash 1/4 meter wide. So the total width for pebbles is 6 * 1/4 = 6/4 = 1.5 meters.\n\nFor rocks, TreQuan throws 3 of them, and each rock makes a splash 1/2 meter wide. So the total width for rocks is 3 * 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5 meters.\n\nFor boulders, TreQuan throws 2 of them, and each boulder makes a splash 2 meters wide. So the total width for boulders is 2 * 2 = 4 meters.\n\nNow, we add up the total widths of all the splashes: 1.5 (pebbles) + 1.5 (rocks) + 4 (boulders) = 7 meters.\n\nThe answer is 7.",

        "First, let's find out how much Niko paid for the 9 pairs of socks in total: 9 pairs * $2 per pair = $18.\n\nFor the 4 pairs of socks that he wants to gain a 25% profit, he will sell each pair for $2 + ($2 * 0.25) = $2.50. So, for these 4 pairs, he will make a profit of 4 pairs * ($2.50 - $2) = $4.\n\nFor the other 5 pairs of socks, he wants to make a profit of $0.2 per pair. So, for each of these pairs, he will sell for $2 + $0.2 = $2.20. For these 5 pairs, he will make a profit of 5 pairs * $0.2 = $1.\n\nNow, let's add up all the profits: $4 (from the 4 pairs) + $1 (from the 5 pairs) + the initial $18 he spent = $18 + $4 + $1 = $23.\n\nThe answer is that his total profit will be $23.",

        "To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it took Leo to finish the third part of his assignment in minutes.\nWe know that:\n1. The assignment was divided into three parts.\n2. Leo finished the first part in 25 minutes.\n3. It took him twice as long to finish the second part.\n4. He finished the entire assignment in 2 hours, which is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.\n\nFrom the information given, we can deduce that the second part took 2 * 25 = 50 minutes to complete.\nSince the entire assignment took 120 minutes, and we know that the first part took 25 minutes and the third part took the remaining time, we can subtract the time for the first part from the total time to find the time for the third part: 120 - 25 = -5 minutes.\nHowever, since time cannot be negative, this means that the third part must have taken the remaining time, which is 120 - 25 + 50 = 75 minutes.\n\nThe answer is that Leo finished the third part of his assignment in 75 minutes.",

Since he has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords, and he has 3 Buicks, that means he has 4 * 3 = 12 Fords.\n\nNow we know that Jim has 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys. So, let's say he has X Chevys. This means he has 2 * 12 = 24 Chevys. And since he has 3 more than 24 Chevys, that means he has 24 + 3 = 27 Chevys.\n\nNow we know that Jim has 27 Chevys, 12 Fords, and 3 Buicks. So, in total, Jim has 27 + 12 + 3 = 301 models.

        "A: First, we need to determine how many floors have gates. Since there are 12 floors and every 3rd floor has a gate, there are 12 / 3 = 4 floors with gates.\n\nNext, we calculate the time it takes to go through each gate. Since it takes 2 minutes per gate and there are 4 gates, it takes 2 * 4 = 8 minutes to go through all the gates.\n\nNow, we need to convert the time spent at the gates to seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, it takes 8 * 60 = 480 seconds at the gates.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive between floors. Since there are 12 floors and each floor is 800 feet away, the total distance to drive is 12 * 800 = 9600 feet. Since drivers drive at 10 feet per second, it takes 9600 / 10 = 960 seconds to drive between all floors.\n\nFinally, we add the time spent at the gates and the time spent driving between floors: 480 seconds (gates) + 960 seconds (driving) = 1440 seconds.

Since each small glass costs $3, the total cost for 8 small glasses is 8 * $3 = $24.\n\nPeter has $50 initially and he leaves with $1 in change after buying the glasses. So, he spent $50 - $1 = $49.\n\nSince each large glass costs $5, let x be the number of large glasses Peter bought. The total cost for the large glasses is x * $5.\n\nSo, the total cost for the 8 small glasses and the large glasses is $24 + (x * $5) = $49 (Peter's remaining amount).\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n$24 + (x * $5) = $49\n\n$5x = $25\n\nx = $25 / $5\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, Peter bought 5 large glasses.",

        "A: Mike earned $160 in total wages this week. He earned wages for his first job, which we'll call X dollars. He also works 12 hours a week at his second job, where he earns $9 per hour. To find out how much he earned from his first job, we need to find out how much he earns in an hour at his first job. Since we don't know the number of hours he worked at his first job, we'll call it Y hours. So, he earned at his first job X dollars from Y hours of work. We know that he earns $9 per hour at his second job, so at his first job he earns Y/Y dollars per hour. Since he earned $160 in total, we can write an equation: X + (Y * $9) = $160. Simplifying, we get X = $160 - (Y * $9). Substituting the values we know, we get $160 - (12 * $9) = X. Solving for X, we get X = $60 - $18. The answer is $42 in dollars.",

So, 301 = Buicks + (3 + 2 * Chevys) + Chevys.\n\nSimplifying, 301 = Buicks + 3 + 2 * Chevys + Chevys.\n\nCombine like terms, 301 = Buicks + 3 + 2 * Chevys + Chevys.\n\nNow, subtract 31 from the first equation, 0 = Buicks + Chevys.\n\nSince Buicks + Chevys = 301 - 3 - 2 * Chevys = 27 - 2 * Chevys, and Buicks = 27 - 2 * Chevys.\n\nSince Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords, we can set up an equation: Buicks = 4 * Fords.\n\nWe can now plug this equation back into the equation we found for Buicks. So, 27 - 2 * Chevys = 4 * Fords.\n\nSince we also know that 3 more than twice the number of Fords as Chevys, we can set up an equation: Fords = 3 + 2 * Chevys.\n\nNow we have two equations we can solve simultaneously: 27 - 2 * Chevys = 4 * (3 + 2 * Chevys).\n\nSubtracting 27 from both sides of the first equation, - 2 * Chevys = 4 * (3 + 2 * Chevys), and simplifying, - 6 * Chevys = 12.\n\nDividing by -6, we find that Chevys = -12 / -6 = 2.\n\nNow",

According to the given information, the second number is 2x (since it is twice the first number). The sum of the two numbers is 33, so x + 2x = 33.\n\nCombining the terms gives us 3x = 33, so x = 33 / 3 = 11. Therefore, the second number is 2 * 11 = 22.",
        "A: Kate bought 3 magic wands at a cost of $x each. She sold each wand for $x + $5. In total, she collected $130 from selling the wands.\n\nTo find out the cost of each wand, we can set up an equation based on the total amount collected and the number of wands and their selling prices. The equation is:\n\n(3 * (x + $5)) = $130\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3x + $15 = $130\n\nNow, we subtract $15 from both sides to find the cost of each wand:\n\n3x = $115\n\nFinally, we divide by 3 to find the cost of each wand:\n\nx = $115 / 3 = $38.33 (approximately)\n\nSo, each wand cost approximately $38.33.",

First, let's add $50,000 to both sides of the equation: 4 * Diego's payment + $1,000 + $50,000 = X.\n\nThis simplifies to: 4 * Diego's payment + $51,000 = X.\n\nNow, let's subtract $51,000 from both sides of the equation: 4 * Diego's payment = X - $51,000.\n\nFinally, let's divide both sides by 4: Diego's payment = (X - $51,000) / 4.\n\nHowever, we don't know the value of X yet. We have one more piece of information: the total payment to the two artists was $50,000, so X = $50,000.\n\nNow we can find Diego's payment: Diego's payment = (X - $51,000) / 4 = (50,000 - $51,000) / 4 = -$1,000 / 4.\n\nSince we can't have a negative amount of money, we know that Diego's payment was actually $1,000 / 4 = $250.\n\nSo, Diego got $250.",

        "First, we need to convert the lengths of the movies and the cooking time into hours.\n\n1 hour and 30 minutes is 1.5 hours.\nThe second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first, which is 0.5 hours.\n\nFor the cooking, making popcorn took 10 minutes, which is 0.1667 hours (10 minutes / 60 minutes per hour).\nMaking fries took twice as long as making popcorn, so it took 0.1667 * 2 = 0.3333 hours.\n\nNow, we can add the time spent watching movies and cooking.\nThe total time is 1.5 (first movie) + 0.5 (second movie) + 0.1667 (popcorn) + 0.3333 (fries) = 2.475 hours.\n\nSince the time must be in hours, we round up to the nearest hour. So, it took Joseph and his friends 3 hours to cook and watch the movies.",
        "A: Each week, Helen washes her pillowcases 4 times. 1 week has 7 days, so Helen washes her pillowcases 4 x 7 = 28 times in 1 week. 1 year has 52 weeks, so in 1 year Helen spends 28 x 52 = 1456 minutes hand washing her pillowcases. 30 minutes are 1 hour. 1456 minutes is equal to 1456/30 = 15 hours. The answer is 15 hours.",
        "First, we need to determine how many clowns Tim bought. Since Tim bought twice as many clowns as Rick bought guppies, and Rick bought 30 guppies, Tim bought 2 * 30 = 60 clowns.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many tetras you bought. Since you bought 4 times as many tetras as Tim bought clowns, you bought 4 * 60 = 240 tetras.\n\nFinally, we add up all the animals you bought: 240 tetras + 60 clowns + 30 guppies = 240 + 60 + 30 = 190 animals. The answer is 190."
