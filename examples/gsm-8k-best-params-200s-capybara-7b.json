        "A: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Frankie has 6 more snakes than cats. Let's represent the number of cats as C. So, the number of snakes is C + 6.\n2. Frankie has one less parrot than cats. So, the number of parrots is C - 1.\n3. Six of his pets have four legs, which are the dogs.\n4. He has 2 dogs.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of pets:\n\n1. C (cats) + (C + 6) (snakes) + (C - 1) (parrots) + 2 (dogs) + 6 (four-legged pets)\n2. C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 6 + 2\n3. 4C + 5\n\nSince we know that Frankie has 2 dogs, we can substitute 2 for 6 in the equation:\n\n4C + 5 = total number of pets\n4C + 5 = C + 6 + (C - 1) + 2\n\nNow, let's solve for C:\n\n4C + 5 = 2C + 5 + C + 6 + 2\n4C - 2C = 13\n2C = 13\nC = 13/2\nC = 6.5\n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a pet, we made an assumption that not all pets were accounted for in the given information. In this case, we can conclude that Frankie has at least 6 cats, which means he has 6 + 6 = 12 pets in total (6 snakes and 1 parrot). But remember, this is a minimum number, and there could be more pets. The answer is at least 12.<|im_end|>",
        "A: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Olaf initially had 150 toy cars.\n2. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many as Uncle, so Grandpa gave 2 * Uncle's cars.\n3. Dad gave Olaf 10 cars, 5 less than Mum, so Mum gave Olaf 10 + 5 = 15 cars.\n4. Auntie gave Olaf 6 cars, 1 more than Uncle, so Uncle gave Olaf 6 - 1 = 5 cars.\n\nNow let's calculate how many cars each family member gave:\n\n- Grandpa: 2 * Uncle's cars\n- Dad: 10 cars\n- Mum: 15 cars\n- Auntie: 6 cars\n\nUncle's cars = 5 cars (as mentioned in the question)\n\nSo, Grandpa gave 2 * 5 = 10 cars.\n\nNow let's add all the cars given by the family members:\n\n10 (Grandpa) + 10 (Dad) + 15 (Mum) + 6 (Auntie) = 41 cars\n\nFinally, let's add the initial 150 cars to the 41 cars given by the family members:\n\n150 (initial) + 41 (from family) = 191 cars\n\nThe answer is 191.<|im_end|>",

Since Roberto used to buy 1 dozen eggs a week, which is 12 eggs, the chickens are already providing enough eggs for him.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many weeks it takes for the initial cost of the chickens to be covered by the savings from not buying store-bought eggs. The initial cost is $80. The savings per week from not buying store-bought eggs is $2 per dozen (since Roberto used to buy 1 dozen).\n\nLet W be the number of weeks. In W weeks, the chickens will produce 12 eggs per week, so in W weeks, they will produce 12 * W eggs. Since each egg lasts forever, the number of eggs produced in W weeks is enough to replace the store-bought eggs for W weeks.\n\nSo, the equation to find the number of weeks is: $80 = $2 per week * W weeks.\n\nSolving for W, we get: $80 = $2 * W, so W = $80 / $2 = 40 weeks.\n\nThe answer is 40 weeks.<|im_end|>",

Therefore, the remaining pets must have 2 legs.\n\n2. Let's assume the number of cats is C, then the number of snakes is C + 6, and the number of parrots is C - 1. Since all pets have 2 legs, we have the equation: C (cats) + (C + 6) (snakes) + (C - 1) (parrots) = 8 (from dogs) + 2(pets).\n\n3. Substituting the equation above into the total pets equation, we get: 2C + 2(C + 7) = 10.\n\n4. Solving the equation 2C + 2C + 14 = 10, we find that C = 1.\n\n5. Now that we know the number of cats is 1, we can find the number of snakes and parrots: snakes = 1 + 6 = 7, parrots = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\n6.

        "A: In the first game, Roosevelt High School scores 30 points. In the second game, they score half as much, which is 30 / 2 = 15 points. In the third game, they score triple as much as the second game, which is 15 * 3 = 45 points. So, Roosevelt High School has 30 + 15 + 45 = 90 points before the bonus. After receiving 50 bonus points, they have 90 + 50 = 140 points. Greendale High School has 10 points less than Roosevelt High School, so they have 140 - 10 = 130 points.

        "A: Jill is 20 years old. So, Roger's age is 2 * 20 + 5 = 45 years old now. In 15 years, Jill will be 20 + 15 = 35 years old. Roger will be 45 + 15 = 60 years old. Since the age difference between them in 15 years will be 30 years less than Finley's age, we can write the equation 60 - 35 = Finley's age - 30. Solving the equation, we find that Finley's age is 60 + 30 = 90 years old. The answer is 90.<|im_end|>",
