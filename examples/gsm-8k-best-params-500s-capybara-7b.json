        "A: Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells, which is 2 x 12 = 24 seashells. Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so he found 24 x 2 = 48 seashells. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, so Leigh had 48 / 3 = 16 seashells. The answer is 16.",
        "A: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Frankie has x number of cats.\n2. Frankie has x + 6 number of snakes.\n3. Frankie has x - 2 number of parrots.\n4. Frankie has 6 number of dogs.\n5. Frankie has 4 number of pets in 6 sets.\n\nNow we can use this information to find the total number of pets:\n\nFrom 1 and 2, we know that the number of cats and snakes differ by 6. So we can write the equation: x + (x + 6) = (x - 2) + (x + 6) + 6 = 2x + 6 - 2 = 2x + 4\n\nFrom 4, we know that 6 of the pets are dogs. Since there are 2 dogs, the total number of pets is 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the total number of pets is 8, and from the equation above, we can find the number of cats, which is x = (8 - 4) / 2 = 2.\n\nSo, Frankie has 2 cats, 2 + 6 = 8 snakes, 2 - 2 = 0 parrots, and 2 dogs. The answer is 8 pets in total.",
        "A: Olaf's collection started with 150 toy cars. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many as the uncle, so if the uncle gave Olaf x toy cars, then Grandpa gave Olaf 2x toy cars. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum, so Mum gave Olaf 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle, so the uncle gave Olaf x toy cars.\n\nNow, let's add up all the toy cars Olaf received: 150 (his original collection) + 2x (from Grandpa) + 10 (from Dad) + x (from Uncle) + 6 (from Auntie) + 15 (from Mum) = 150 + 2x + x + 6 + 15 = 186 + x.\n\nSince Auntie gave Olaf 1 more than the uncle, we know that x + 1 = 6, so x = 5.\n\nNow we can find out how many toy cars Olaf received in total: 186 + x = 186 + 5 = 191.\n\nThe answer is 191.",
        "A: At the start of the week, Emma has $100 in her account. Each day, she spends $8, so by the end of the week, she has spent $8 x 7 = $56. Her account then has $100 - $56 = $44 remaining. She asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give, which is $44 / $5 = $8.8 bills. Each $5 bill is worth $5, so she receives $8 x $5 = $40. The remaining amount in her account is $40.

        "A: First, we need to find the total width of the splashes for each type of rock.\n\nFor pebbles, TreQuan throws 6 of them, and each pebble makes a splash 1/4 meter wide. So the total width for pebbles is 6 * 1/4 = 6/4 = 1.5 meters.\n\nFor rocks, TreQuan throws 3 of them, and each rock makes a splash 1/2 meter wide. So the total width for rocks is 3 * 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5 meters.\n\nFor boulders, TreQuan throws 2 of them, and each boulder makes a splash 2 meters wide. So the total width for boulders is 2 * 2 = 4 meters.\n\nNow, we add up the total widths of all the splashes: 1.5 (pebbles) + 1.5 (rocks) + 4 (boulders) = 7 meters.\n\nThe answer is 7.",

        "First, let's find out how much Niko paid for the 9 pairs of socks in total: 9 pairs * $2 per pair = $18.\n\nFor the 4 pairs of socks that he wants to gain a 25% profit, he will sell each pair for $2 + ($2 * 0.25) = $2.50. So, for these 4 pairs, he will make a profit of 4 pairs * ($2.50 - $2) = $4.\n\nFor the other 5 pairs of socks, he wants to make a profit of $0.2 per pair. So, for each of these pairs, he will sell for $2 + $0.2 = $2.20. For these 5 pairs, he will make a profit of 5 pairs * $0.2 = $1.\n\nNow, let's add up all the profits: $4 (from the 4 pairs) + $1 (from the 5 pairs) + the initial $18 he spent = $18 + $4 + $1 = $23.\n\nThe answer is that his total profit will be $23.",

        "To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it took Leo to finish the third part of his assignment in minutes.\nWe know that:\n1. The assignment was divided into three parts.\n2. Leo finished the first part in 25 minutes.\n3. It took him twice as long to finish the second part.\n4. He finished the entire assignment in 2 hours, which is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.\n\nFrom the information given, we can deduce that the second part took 2 * 25 = 50 minutes to complete.\nSince the entire assignment took 120 minutes, and we know that the first part took 25 minutes and the third part took the remaining time, we can subtract the time for the first part from the total time to find the time for the third part: 120 - 25 = -5 minutes.\nHowever, since time cannot be negative, this means that the third part must have taken the remaining time, which is 120 - 25 + 50 = 75 minutes.\n\nThe answer is that Leo finished the third part of his assignment in 75 minutes.",

Since he has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords, and he has 3 Buicks, that means he has 4 * 3 = 12 Fords.\n\nNow we know that Jim has 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys. So, let's say he has X Chevys. This means he has 2 * 12 = 24 Chevys. And since he has 3 more than 24 Chevys, that means he has 24 + 3 = 27 Chevys.\n\nNow we know that Jim has 27 Chevys, 12 Fords, and 3 Buicks. So, in total, Jim has 27 + 12 + 3 = 301 models.

        "A: First, we need to determine how many floors have gates. Since there are 12 floors and every 3rd floor has a gate, there are 12 / 3 = 4 floors with gates.\n\nNext, we calculate the time it takes to go through each gate. Since it takes 2 minutes per gate and there are 4 gates, it takes 2 * 4 = 8 minutes to go through all the gates.\n\nNow, we need to convert the time spent at the gates to seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, it takes 8 * 60 = 480 seconds at the gates.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive between floors. Since there are 12 floors and each floor is 800 feet away, the total distance to drive is 12 * 800 = 9600 feet. Since drivers drive at 10 feet per second, it takes 9600 / 10 = 960 seconds to drive between all floors.\n\nFinally, we add the time spent at the gates and the time spent driving between floors: 480 seconds (gates) + 960 seconds (driving) = 1440 seconds.

Since each small glass costs $3, the total cost for 8 small glasses is 8 * $3 = $24.\n\nPeter has $50 initially and he leaves with $1 in change after buying the glasses. So, he spent $50 - $1 = $49.\n\nSince each large glass costs $5, let x be the number of large glasses Peter bought. The total cost for the large glasses is x * $5.\n\nSo, the total cost for the 8 small glasses and the large glasses is $24 + (x * $5) = $49 (Peter's remaining amount).\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n$24 + (x * $5) = $49\n\n$5x = $25\n\nx = $25 / $5\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, Peter bought 5 large glasses.",

        "A: Mike earned $160 in total wages this week. He earned wages for his first job, which we'll call X dollars. He also works 12 hours a week at his second job, where he earns $9 per hour. To find out how much he earned from his first job, we need to find out how much he earns in an hour at his first job. Since we don't know the number of hours he worked at his first job, we'll call it Y hours. So, he earned at his first job X dollars from Y hours of work. We know that he earns $9 per hour at his second job, so at his first job he earns Y/Y dollars per hour. Since he earned $160 in total, we can write an equation: X + (Y * $9) = $160. Simplifying, we get X = $160 - (Y * $9). Substituting the values we know, we get $160 - (12 * $9) = X. Solving for X, we get X = $60 - $18. The answer is $42 in dollars.",

        "A: Ethyl bought Lucy two new dolls, which increased the doll collection by 25%. This means the size of the collection increased by 25% of the original size. To find the original size, we can divide the increase (25%) by the percentage increase (100%), so 25% / 100% = 0.25.\n\nIf the original size was x dolls, then the increase was 0.25 * x = 25% of x. So, 25% of x is equal to 2 dolls (since Ethyl bought two new dolls). Therefore, 0.25 * x = 2. To find x, we can divide both sides by 0.25, so x = 2 / 0.25 = 8.\n\nAfter the addition of the two new dolls, the collection has 8 + 2 = 10 dolls. The answer is 10.",

Therefore, he needs to collect 500 - 300 = 200 tins in the remaining 4 days of the week.\n\nSince he collects an equal number of tins each day for the rest of the week, he needs to collect 200 / 4 = 50 tins per day for the rest of the week.

        "A: First, we need to calculate the total width of the splashes for each type of rock.\n\nFor pebbles, there are 6 pebbles and each pebble makes a splash 1/4 meter wide. So, the total width of the splashes for pebbles is 6 * (1/4) = 6/4 = 1.5 meters.\n\nFor rocks, there are 3 rocks and each rock makes a splash 1/2 meter wide. So, the total width of the splashes for rocks is 3 * (1/2) = 3/2 = 1.5 meters.\n\nFor boulders, there are 2 boulders and each boulder makes a splash 2 meters wide. So, the total width of the splashes for boulders is 2 * 2 = 4 meters.\n\nNow, we add up the total widths of the splashes for all types of rocks: 1.5 (pebbles) + 1.5 (rocks) + 4 (boulders) = 7 meters.\n\nThe answer is 7 meters.",

        "To find the number of books in the library, we need to add the number of books for children and adults.\n\nChildren's books: 35% of the total books, so 35% of the total books = the number of books for children.\nAdult's books: 104% of the total books, so 104% of the total books = the number of books for adults.\n\nLet's say the total number of books is x. Then, we have two equations:\n\n35% of x = number of books for children\n104% of x = number of books for adults\n\nTo solve for x, we can first find 35% of x and 104% of x. We can do this by converting the percentages to decimals: 35% = 0.35 and 104% = 0.104.\n\nSo, 0.35x represents the number of books for children, and 0.104x represents the number of books for adults.\n\nThe number of books for children and adults together is 0.35x + 0.104x. But this must also be equal to the total number of books, x. So we have the equation:\n\n0.35x + 0.104x = x\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n\n0.35x + 0.104x - x = 0\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n-0.646x = 0\n\nDividing both sides by -0.646, we get:\n\nx = 0\n\nSo, the total number of books in the library is 0, which doesn't make sense. This is because the problem has a small error: the percentages 35% and 104% should be displayed as 35% and 104%, not as decimals.\n\nTo find the number of books in the library, we need to add the number of books for children and adults.\n\nChildren's books: 35% of the total books, so 35% of the total books = the number",

Each advanced class has 20 students, so there are 3 * 20 = 60 students in the advanced classes.\n\nSince there are 6 additional classes per grade level, and each grade level has the same number of students in the additional classes, we can find the number of students in each additional class by dividing the remaining students (1590 - 636 = 954 students) by the total number of students in each grade level (3 grade levels * 6 additional classes per grade level = 18 additional classes): 954 students / 18 additional classes = 53 students per additional class.\n\nSince each grade level has one advanced class and 6 additional classes, there are 6 additional classes - 1 advanced class = 5 normal classes per grade level. So, the number of students in each normal class at the new school is 53 students per additional class.\n\nThe answer is 53 students per normal class.",

In total, she has $20 + $10 = $30 from quarters and dimes. Since she has a total of $90 after emptying all machines, we can subtract the $30 she already has to find out how much money was in each machine: $90 - $30 = $60 per machine.\n\nSince each machine held the same amount of money, we can find out how many machines are in the launderette by dividing the total amount of money ($90) by the amount of money per machine ($60): $90 / $60 = 1.5 machines. Since there cannot be half a machine, there must be 1 complete machine's worth of money less. Therefore, there are 1 + 1 = 2 machines in the launderette. The answer is 2.",

        "A: Let's first find out Roger's current age. Since Jill is 20 years old, and Roger's age is 5 more than twice Jill's age, then Roger's age is 5 + 2 * 20 = 5 + 40 = 45 years old.\n\nNow, let's find their ages in 15 years. In 15 years, Jill will be 20 + 15 = 35 years old. Roger will be 45 + 15 = 60 years old. The age difference between them will be 60 - 35 = 25 years.\n\nSince the age difference will be 30 years less than Finley's age in 15 years, we can write the equation: 25 + 15 = Finley's age - 30. This gives us Finley's age in 15 years as 40 years.\n\nNow, to find Finley's current age, we subtract 15 years from 40 years: 40 - 15 = 25 years old. The answer is 25.",

She gave 8 pens and 6 pencils to each of her 7 friends, which means she gave away a total of 8 * 7 = 56 pens and 6 * 7 = 42 pencils. So, she gave away a total of 56 + 42 = 98 items (either pens or pencils). She started with 60 pens and 60 pencils, so she had 60 + 60 = 120 items left. Out of these 120 items, 98 have been given away, so she has 120 - 98 = 22 items left. Since she had an equal number of pens and pencils, she has 22 / 2 = 11 pens and 11 pencils left.

        "First, let's find out how many pills Tom takes in a year. He takes 2 pills every day, so in a year (365 days), he takes 2 * 365 = 730 pills.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much he pays for the pills per year, considering the insurance coverage. Insurance covers 80% of the $5 per pill cost, so it covers 0.8 * $5 = $4 per pill. This means Tom pays $5 - $4 = $1 per pill for the medication.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much he pays for the pills in a year: 730 pills * $1 per pill = $730.\n\nTom visits the doctor every 6 months, so he visits the doctor twice a year. Each visit costs $400, so his total doctor visits cost for a year is 2 * $400 = $800.\n\nFinally, let's add up the costs for the pills and the doctor visits: $730 (pills) + $800 (doctor visits) = $1530.\n\nThe answer is Tom pays $1530 a year for everything.",

        "First, we need to convert the 600 pounds of carbon dioxide to ounces. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so 600 pounds = 600 * 16 = 9600 ounces of carbon dioxide.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much carbon dioxide is released per shopping trip with plastic bags. Marla uses 8 plastic bags per shopping trip, and each bag releases 4 ounces of carbon dioxide. So, for 8 bags, the total carbon dioxide released is 8 * 4 = 32 ounces.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many shopping trips Marla needs to make for the canvas bag to be the lower-carbon solution. To do this, we divide the carbon dioxide released by the canvas bag (9600 ounces) by the carbon dioxide released per shopping trip with plastic bags (32 ounces). 9600 / 32 = 300.\n\nThe answer is Marla will have to make 300 shopping trips before the canvas bag is the lower-carbon solution.",

Dividing both sides by 72, we get y = (36x) / 72, which means y = 3x / 2.\n\nSo, it takes Jenna 3x / 2 minutes to hem her dress.\n\nThe answer is 3x / 2.",

        "First, we need to find out how many animals were in the zoo before the changes. Before the gorilla family left, there were 68 animals. After the hippopotamus arrived, there was 1 (hippopotamus) more animal. So, there were 68 - 1 = 67 animals in the zoo before the endangered rhinos arrived.\n\nAfter the endangered rhinos arrived, there were 3 (rhinos) more animals. So, there were 67 + 3 = 70 animals in the zoo before the lioness gave birth to cubs and the meerkat exhibit opened.\n\nAfter the meerkat exhibit opened, there were twice as many meerkats as lion cubs. Let's say there were x lion cubs. Then there were 2x meerkats. So, the total number of animals in the zoo after the meerkat exhibit opened was 70 + 2x (meerkats) + x (lion cubs) = 90 animals.\n\nWe can write this as 2x + x + 70 = 90. Combining like terms, we get 3x + 70 = 90. Subtracting 70 from both sides, we get 3x = 20. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 20/3. So, there were 20/3 = 6.67... lion cubs born at the zoo.

The video game costs 50 dollars, and with the 10 percent sales tax, it will cost 50 + (50 * 0.1) = 50 + 5 = 55 dollars.\n\nSince Nina's savings are 5 dollars per week, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her savings to reach 55 dollars. We can do this by dividing the total amount needed (55 dollars) by the weekly savings (5 dollars per week): 55 / 5 = 11 weeks.\n\nSo, it will take 11 weeks for Nina to be able to buy the new video game with her savings.",
        "A: Robby sets aside 9 brown M&M's on the first bag, 12 on the second, 8 on the third and fourth, and 3 on the fifth. To find the average, we add the number of brown M&M's in each bag and divide by the total number of bags.\n\nSo, the total number of brown M&M's is 9 + 12 + 8 + 8 + 3 = 40.\nAnd the total number of bags is 5.\n\nNow, we can find the average: 40 / 5 = 8.\n\nThe answer is 8.",
        "A: Let's assume the amount Joseph pays for the power used by the water heater is x. According to the given information, the refrigerator consumes 3 times the power of the water heater, so it consumes 3x power.\n\nNow, we know that the total amount Joseph pays for the power used by these gadgets is the sum of the power consumed by each gadget: refrigerator, water heater, and the electric oven. The electric oven consumes $500 worth of power per month, and the water heater consumes x worth of power per month.\n\nSo, the total amount Joseph pays for the power used by these gadgets is: 3x (refrigerator) + x (water heater) + $500 (electric oven).\n\nWe also know that the power consumed by the electric oven is twice the power consumed by the water heater, so x (water heater) = $500 / 2 = $250.\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of x back into the equation for the total amount Joseph pays: 3x + x + $500 = 4x + $500.\n\nSince we know that x (water heater) = $250, we can substitute this value into the equation: 4($250) + $500 = 4x + $500.\n\nThis simplifies to: 4($250) = 4x, so 4x = $1000.\n\nNow, we can find the total amount Joseph pays for the power used by these gadgets by solving for 4x in the equation 4x + $500 = total amount: 4x = total amount - $500.\n\nSince 4x = $1000, the total amount Joseph pays for the power used by these gadgets is: $1000 = total amount - $500.\n\nTotal amount = $1000 + $500 = $1500.\n\nThe answer is $1500.",

There are 365 days in a year, and he takes 2 pills every day, so he takes 2 * 365 = 730 pills in a year.\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the pills without insurance. Since insurance covers 80% of the cost, Tom pays 100% - 80% = 20% of the cost. For 730 pills, he pays 20% of $5 per pill, which is 0.20 * $5 * 730 = $730.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the doctor visits. He visits the doctor every 6 months, so he visits the doctor twice a year. At $400 per visit, he pays 2 * $400 = $800 for doctor visits in a year.\n\nFinally, let's add up all the costs.

The courtyard measures 10 feet by 25 feet, so the area is 10 * 25 = 250 square feet.\n\nSince Jackson needs 4 tiles per square foot of space, he needs 4 * 250 = 1000 tiles in total.\n\n40% of the tiles are green marble, so 40% of 1000 tiles are green marble tiles, which is 0.4 * 1000 = 40 tiles.\n\nThe green marble tiles cost $3/tile, so the cost of the green marble tiles is 40 * $3 = $120.\n\nThe rest of the tiles are red tiles, which cost $1.50/tile, so the cost of the red tiles is (1000 - 40) * $1.50 = $675.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the tiles is $120 + $675 = $795. The answer is $795.",

        "A: Let's denote the number of cans Rachel brought in as R. Then Jaydon brought in 2R + 5 cans, and Mark brought in 4 times as many cans as Jaydon, which is 4(2R + 5) = 8R + 20 cans.\n\nThe total number of cans is the sum of the cans brought in by each person: R + (2R + 5) + (8R + 20) = 135.\n\nCombining the terms, we get 11R + 25 = 135. Subtracting 25 from both sides, we have 11R = 110. Dividing both sides by 11, we find R = 10.\n\nNow, we can find how many cans Mark brought in: 8R + 20 = 8(10) + 20 = 80 + 20 = 100 cans.

So, she uses a total of 30 + 32 = 62 ounces of water. She started with 122 ounces, so she has 122 - 62 = -50 ounces remaining. Since this doesn't make sense, there must have been 122 - 62 = 50 ounces remaining. To find how many 4-ounce glasses she can fill, divide 50 by 4, which is 50 / 4 = 12.5.

        "A: If there are 25 people in each group and 3 groups, then there are 25 * 3 = 75 people in total. Since there are also 14 girls and 11 boys, there are 75 - 14 - 11 = 50 people who are not girls or boys. So, there are 50 - 46 = 4 parents at the park. The answer is 4.",
        "A singer is planning on releasing 3 songs in a month, and each song takes 10 days to be completed. Since there are 10 hours of work per day, the total number of hours for one song is 10 days * 10 hours/day = 100 hours. To complete 3 songs, the total number of hours would be 3 songs * 100 hours/song = 300 hours. The answer is 300.",
        "To finish the combined undergrad and Ph.D. program in 3/4th of the time, it takes Tom 3 years (for the BS) and 5 years (for the Ph.D.) * 3/4 = 2 years for the BS and 5 years for the Ph.D. \n\nSo, it takes Tom a total of 2 + 5 = 7 years to finish the program. The answer is 7.",
        "A: Antoine supplies 2 sacks to the first bakery, 4 sacks to the second bakery, and 12 sacks to the third bakery per week. To supply all the bakeries in a week, he needs 2 + 4 + 12 = 18 sacks of strawberries. In 4 weeks, he will need 18 * 4 = 72 sacks of strawberries. The answer is 72.",
        "A: Jury selection takes 2 days. The trial itself lasts 4 times as long as jury selection, which means it lasts 2 * 4 = 8 days. The number of hours spent in jury deliberation is equivalent to 6 full days, which means they spend 6 * 24 = 144 hours in deliberation. Since they spend 16 hours a day in deliberation, the number of days they spend in deliberation is 144 / 16 = 9 days. So, John spends a total of 2 (jury selection) + 8 (trial) + 9 (deliberation) = 19 days on jury duty. The answer is 19.",
        "First, let's calculate the total cost of the clothes Carrie buys:\n\n4 shirts * $8 per shirt = $32\n2 pairs of pants * $18 per pair = $36\n2 jackets * $60 per jacket = $120\n\nNow, let's add up the costs of all the clothes:\n$32 (shirts) + $36 (pants) + $120 (jackets) = $198\n\nCarrie's mom pays for half of the total cost, so we need to divide the total cost by 2:\n$198 / 2 = $99\n\nSince Carrie's mom pays for half, Carrie has to pay the other half, which is also $99. The answer is $99.",
        "A: Don initially had 12oz of rum and then consumed 10oz from Sally's pancakes. So, he had a total of 12 + 10 = 22oz of rum. The maximum amount he can have is 3 times the 10oz from Sally, which is 3 * 10 = 30oz. Since he already had 22oz, he can have 30 - 22 = 8oz of rum after eating all the pancakes and rum. The answer is 8.",
        "A: The sum of Hannah's brothers' ages is 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 years old. If Hannah is twice as old as the sum of her brothers' ages, then she is 2 * 24 = 48 years old. The answer is 48.",
        "A: First, we need to find the total number of carnations from the first two bouquets. For the first bouquet, there are 9 carnations, and for the second bouquet, there are 14 carnations. So, the total is 9 + 14 = 23 carnations.\n\nSince the average number of carnations in all three bouquets is 12, we can find the number of carnations in the third bouquet by finding the difference between the total number of carnations (23) and the sum of the carnations in the first two bouquets (2 * 12 = 24). So, the third bouquet has 23 - 24 = -1 carnation. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as there should be a positive number of carnations in the third bouquet. The problem likely has a mistake, and we should use the average number of carnations (12) as the number of carnations in the third bouquet.\n\nThe answer is 12.",
        "A: First, let's find out how many shrimp Austin caught. Since Austin's trap caught 8 less than Victor's, Austin caught 26 - 8 = 18 shrimp.\n\nNext, let's find the total number of shrimp caught by Victor and Austin. Together, they caught 26 + 18 = 44 shrimp.\n\nNow, let's find how many shrimp Brian caught. Brian's trap caught half of Victor and Austin's total number of shrimp, so Brian caught 44 / 2 = 22 shrimp.\n\nThe total number of shrimp caught by all three boys is 26 + 18 + 22 = 66 shrimp.\n\nThey sold their shrimp for $7 for every 11 tails of shrimp. So, the total amount of money they made is 66 * $7 / 11 = $44.\n\nFinally, let's divide the total earnings equally among the three boys. Each boy makes $44 / 3 = $14.40. The answer is $14.40.",
        "A: The swimmer reaches the third buoy when they have swum 72 meters. Since buoys are placed at even intervals, the distance between each buoy is 72 meters / 3 buoys = 24 meters. The fourth buoy is 24 meters away from the third buoy, so it is 24 meters + 72 meters (the distance the swimmer has swum) = 96 meters from the beach. The answer is 96.",

        "A: Let's call the contributions of Angela, Brittany, and Niraj as A, B, and N. We are given that B = 2A and N = 1/3A.\nWe can use the formula B = 2A to find A: 2A = A, so A = 1A. And we can use the formula N = 1/3A to find N: 1/3A = N, so N = 1/3A = 1/3(1A) = 1/3 + 2/3 + 1.\nSo, the total contribution is A + B + N = 1A + 2A + 1/3A + 1/3A + 1/3A = 1A + 1/3A = 5/3A = 1 + 2/3 + 1 = 1 + 2/3 + 1 = $80.",

        "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Bill picked 50 apples from the orchard.\n2. He has 3 kids, and each gets 3 apples for their 2 favorite teachers. So, each kid gets 3 apples, and there are 3 kids, which means 3 kids * 3 apples = 9 apples are used for the teachers.\n3. Bill's wife Jill bakes 2 apple pies, using 10 apples per pie. So, for the 2 pies, they use 2 pies * 10 apples per pie = 20 apples.\n4. Adding up all the apples used: 50 apples (from the orchard) - 9 apples (for the teachers) - 20 apples (for the pies) = 21 apples are left.\n\nThe answer is 21 apples.",
