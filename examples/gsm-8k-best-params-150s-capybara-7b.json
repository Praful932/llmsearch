        "A: Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells, which is 2 * 12 = 24 seashells. Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so he found 24 * 2 = 48 seashells. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, so Leigh had 48 / 3 = 16 seashells. The answer is 16.",
        "A: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Frankie has 6 more snakes than cats. Let's represent the number of cats as C. So, the number of snakes is C + 6.\n2. Frankie has one less parrot than cats. So, the number of parrots is C - 1.\n3. Six of his pets have four legs, which are the dogs.\n4. He has 2 dogs.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of pets:\n\n1. C (cats) + (C + 6) (snakes) + (C - 1) (parrots) + 2 (dogs) + 6 (four-legged pets)\n2. C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 6 + 2\n3. 4C + 5\n\nSince we know that Frankie has 2 dogs, we can substitute 2 for 6 in the equation:\n\n4C + 5 = total number of pets\n4C + 5 = C + 6 + (C - 1) + 2\n\nNow, let's solve for C:\n\n4C + 5 = 2C + 5 + C + 6 + 2\n4C - 2C = 13\n2C = 13\nC = 13/2\nC = 6.5\n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a pet, we made an assumption that not all pets were accounted for in the given information. In this case, we can conclude that Frankie has at least 6 cats, which means he has 6 + 6 = 12 pets in total (6 snakes and 1 parrot). But remember, this is a minimum number, and there could be more pets. The answer is at least 12.",
        "A: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Olaf initially had 150 toy cars.\n2. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many as Uncle, so Grandpa gave 2 * Uncle's cars.\n3. Dad gave Olaf 10 cars, 5 less than Mum, so Mum gave Olaf 10 + 5 = 15 cars.\n4. Auntie gave Olaf 6 cars, 1 more than Uncle, so Uncle gave Olaf 6 - 1 = 5 cars.\n\nNow let's calculate how many cars each family member gave:\n\n- Grandpa: 2 * Uncle's cars\n- Dad: 10 cars\n- Mum: 15 cars\n- Auntie: 6 cars\n\nUncle's cars = 5 cars (as mentioned in the question)\n\nSo, Grandpa gave 2 * 5 = 10 cars.\n\nNow let's add all the cars given by the family members:\n\n10 (Grandpa) + 10 (Dad) + 15 (Mum) + 6 (Auntie) = 41 cars\n\nFinally, let's add the initial 150 cars to the 41 cars given by the family members:\n\n150 (initial) + 41 (from family) = 191 cars\n\nThe answer is 191.",
        "A: Emma starts with $100 in her account. She spends $8 each day for a week, which is 7 days. So she spends 8 * 7 = $56 during the week. She has $100 - $56 = $44 left in her account. She asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give her, which is $44 / $5 = 8 $5 bills. So she takes out 8 * $5 = $40 from her account. She leaves the remaining $44 - $40 = $4 in her account.

        "A: First, we need to find the total width of the splashes made by each type of rock.\n\nFor pebbles, there are 6 pebbles and each pebble makes a splash 1/4 meter wide. So, the total width of the pebble splashes is 6 * (1/4) = 6/4 = 1.5 meters.\n\nFor rocks, there are 3 rocks and each rock makes a splash 1/2 meter wide. So, the total width of the rock splashes is 3 * (1/2) = 3/2 = 1.5 meters.\n\nFor boulders, there are 2 boulders and each boulder makes a splash 2 meters wide. So, the total width of the boulder splashes is 2 * 2 = 4 meters.\n\nNow, we add up the total width of all the splashes: 1.5 (pebbles) + 1.5 (rocks) + 4 (boulders) = 1.5 + 1.5 + 4 = 7 meters.\n\nThe answer is 7.",

Since it takes 2 minutes per gate and there are 4 gates, it takes 2 * 4 = 8 minutes to go through all the gates.\n\nNow, we need to convert the time spent at the gates to seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, it takes 8 * 60 = 480 seconds at the gates.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive between floors. Since there are 12 floors and each floor is 800 feet away, the total distance to drive is 12 * 800 = 9600 feet. Since drivers drive at 10 feet per second, it takes 9600 / 10 = 960 seconds to drive between all floors.\n\nFinally, we add the time spent at the gates and the time spent driving between floors: 480 seconds (gates) + 960 seconds (driving) = 1440 seconds.

Subtracting 1,000 from both sides, we have 5D = 49,000. Dividing both sides by 5, we find that Diego got D = 49,000 / 5 = 9,800. The answer is 9,800.",

        "A: Let's work backwards. On the third day, Jen has 8 cookies left. The day before, she ate half of the remaining cookies, so there were 8 * 2 = 16 cookies left before eating half. On the second day, she had 16 cookies, which is three-quarters of the original amount. So, 16 = (3/4) * original amount. To find the original amount, we can multiply both sides by 4/3: Original amount = 16 * (4/3) = 64/3 = 21.33 (approximately). However, since the number of cookies must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 22. The answer is 22.",

So, the spool is 15 * 12 = 180 inches long.\n\nAmy wants to cut the string into equal parts of 6-inch and 12-inch wicks. To find the total number of wicks, we first need to determine how many 6-inch and 12-inch wicks can be made.\n\nFor 12-inch wicks, the string length is a multiple of 12, so no cutting is needed. There is 180 inches, which is exactly 15 * 12 inches. So, there are 15 12-inch wicks.\n\nFor 6-inch wicks, the string length is not a multiple of 6. To find out how many 6-inch wicks can be made, we subtract the number of 12-inch wicks (15) from the total length in inches (180). So, 180 - 15 * 6 = 180 - 90 = 90 inches are left for 6-inch wicks. Since each 6-inch wick requires 6 inches, there are 90 / 6 = 15 6-inch wicks.\n\nIn total, Amy will have cut 15 (12-inch wicks) + 15 (6-inch wicks) = 30 wicks. The answer is 30.",

We know that the total number of employees is 180, so we can write the equation x + y = 180. We also know that there are 20 fewer men than women, so we can write the equation x = y - 20. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for one of the variables: (y - 20) + y = 180. Combining the terms, we get 2y - 20 = 180. Adding 20 to both sides, we get 2y = 200. Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 100. Now that we know there are 100 women, we can find the number of men by substituting y back into the equation x = y - 20. So, x = 100 - 20 = 80. The answer is 80 men.",

Trevor's brother being three times as old as Trevor is now is an impossible situation, as it would require Trevor's brother to be older than himself by more than 13 years, which is not possible. The answer is impossible, given the problem statement.",

Since her phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget, we can calculate her food budget by dividing her phone bill budget by 0.1 (10% as a decimal).\n\nLuna's phone bill budget is unknown, so let's call it \"x\". Therefore, her food budget is x / 0.1 = 10x.\n\nNow we know that her total budget for house rental and food is $240, so we can write the equation: $400 + $10x = $240.\n\nTo find Luna's phone bill budget (x), we need to solve this equation for x. First, we'll subtract $400 from both sides: $10x = $240 - $400 = -$160.\n\nNow, we'll divide both sides by 10: x = -$160 / 10 = -$16.\n\nSo, Luna's phone bill budget is $16.\n\nFinally, to find Luna's total monthly budget, we need to add her house rental budget, her food budget, and her phone bill budget: $400 + $10x + $16 = $400 + $10(-$16) + $16 = $400 - $160 + $16 = $244.\n\nThe answer is $244.",
