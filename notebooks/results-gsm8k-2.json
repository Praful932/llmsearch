        "A: First, let's find out how many floors have gates. 12 / 3 = 4. So, there are 4 floors with gates. It takes 2 minutes to go through a gate, so it takes 2 * 4 = 8 minutes to go through all the gates. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 8 / 60 = 0.1333333333333333333333333333 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 0.1333333333333333333333333333 hours is equal to 0.1333333333333333333333333333 * 60 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 8 minutes to go through all the gates. Now, let's figure out how long it takes to drive from the top to the bottom. There are 12 floors, and 12 - 4 = 8 floors without gates. There are 8 floors without gates, and each floor is 800 feet, so it's 8 * 800 = 6400 feet. It takes 10 feet/second to drive, so it takes 6400 / 10 = 640 seconds to drive from the top to the bottom. Adding the time to go through the gates, it takes 8 + 640 = 748 seconds to get from the top to the bottom of the garage. The answer is 748.<|im_end|>",
