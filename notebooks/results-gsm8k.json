        "A: Frankie has 2 dogs, which is 2 x 4 = 8 legs. He has 6 pets with 4 legs, so he has 6 x 4 = 24 legs total from those pets. He has 6 snakes, so he has 6 x 0 = 0 legs (since snakes don't have legs). He has 1 less parrot than cats, so he has cats. He has cats, so he has legs from cats. He has 6 snakes, so he has 6 x 0 = 0 legs (since snakes don't have legs). He has 24 legs from his 6 pets with 4 legs, 0 legs from snakes, and legs from cats. So he has 24 + 0 + legs = 24 + 6 = 30 legs total. He has 2 dogs, 6 pets with 4 legs, and 1 parrot, so he has 2 + 6 + 1 = 9 pets that have legs. He has 30 legs total, so he has 30 / 4 = 7.5. Since he can't have half a pet, he must have 7 pets that have legs. He has 6 snakes, so he has 6 + 7 = 13 pets in total. The answer is 13.<|im_end|>",
