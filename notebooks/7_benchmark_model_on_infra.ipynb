P = C - 1 (He has one less parrot than cats)\\n3. 6 pets have four legs, which are the dogs. So, 2 dogs + 4-legged pets = total pets.\\n\\nWe know there are 2 dogs, so 2 + 4-legged pets = total pets. Since 6 pets have four legs, there are 6 - 2 = 4-legged pets left, which are the cats.\\n\\nNow we can find the number of each type of pet:\\nC = 4-legged pets = 4\\nS = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10\\nP = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\\n\\nSo, Frankie has 4 cats, 10 snakes, and 3 parrots.

She spends $8 per day for a week, so she spends 7 * 8 = $56. After spending, she has $100 - $56 = $44 left in her account. She asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give her, which is $44 / 5 = 8.8, but she can only get whole bills, so she gets 8 bills. Each bill is worth $5, so she takes out 8 * 5 = $40.

How many pets does he have in total?<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\nA: Let's use variables to represent the number of each type of pet. Let x be the number of cats, s be the number of snakes, and p be the number of parrots.\\n\\nWe know that s = x + 6 (Frankie has six more snakes than cats).\\nWe also know that p = x - 1 (Frankie has one less parrot than cats).\\n\\nWe know that 6 pets have four legs, and these are the cats, snakes, and dogs. So, x + s + 2 (the number of dogs) = 6.\\n\\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for x, s, and p from the previous equations into this equation:\\n\\nx + (x + 6) + 2 = 6\\n2x + 6 + 2 = 6\\n2x + 8 = 6\\n\\nNow, we can solve for x:\\n\\n2x = 6 - 8\\n2x = -2\\nx = -1\\n\\nSince we can't have a negative number of cats, there must be an error in the problem statement.

Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\nA: Let's first find out how many toy cars Grandpa gave Olaf. Since Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many as Uncle, and Uncle gave Olaf 6 toy cars, Grandpa gave Olaf 2 * 6 = 12 toy cars.\\n\\nNow let's find out how many toy cars Dad gave Olaf. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. So Mum gave Olaf 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars.\\n\\nNow we know the number of toy cars each family member gave Olaf: Grandpa (12), Dad (10), Mum (15), and Auntie (6).\\n\\nTo find the total number of toy cars Olaf received, we add all these numbers together: 12 + 10 + 15 + 6 = 43.\\n\\nSince Olaf initially had 150 toy cars in his collection, after receiving all these gifts, he has a total of 150 + 43 = 193 toy cars.

On the second day, he covered half the full hike distance, which is 50 kilometers / 2 = 25 kilometers. So, on the first and second days combined, he hiked 10 + 25 = 35 kilometers.

If he collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, what's the number of tins he collected each day for the rest of the week?<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\nA: On the second day, James collects 3 times the number of tins he collected on the first day, which is 3 * 50 = 150 tins. On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than the second day, so he collects 150 - 50 = 100 tins.\\n\\nIn total, for the first three days, James collected 50 (first day) + 150 (second day) + 100 (third day) = 300 tins.\\n\\nHe has 500 tins to collect in total, so he has 500 - 300 = 200 tins left to collect for the rest of the week.\\n\\nSince he collects an equal number of tins each day for the remaining days, he will collect 200 / 4 = 50 tins per day for the rest of the week.

Rocks make a splash that is 1/2 a meter wide, and boulders create a splash that is 2 meters wide. If he tosses 6 pebbles, 3 rocks, and 2 boulders, what is the total width of the splashes he makes?<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\nA: First, we need to find the total width of the splashes made by each type of rock. For pebbles, it's 1/4 meter per pebble, and he throws 6 pebbles, so the total width for pebbles is 1/4 * 6 = 1.5 meters.\\n\\nFor rocks, it's 1/2 a meter per rock, and he throws 3 rocks, so the total width for rocks is 1/2 * 3 = 1.5 meters.\\n\\nFor boulders, it's 2 meters per boulder, and he throws 2 boulders, so the total width for boulders is 2 * 2 = 4 meters.\\n\\nNow, we add the total widths of the splashes for each type of rock: 1.5 (pebbles) + 1.5 (rocks) + 4 (boulders) = 7 meters.

If the fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, how many blocks did Thomas use in all?<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\nA: The first stack has 7 blocks. The second stack is 3 blocks taller, so it has 7 + 3 = 10 blocks. The third stack is 6 blocks shorter, so it has 10 - 6 = 4 blocks. The fourth stack is 10 blocks taller, so it has 4 + 10 = 14 blocks. The fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, so it has 10 * 2 = 20 blocks. To find the total number of blocks, add all the blocks together: 7 + 10 + 4 + 14 + 20 = 55.
