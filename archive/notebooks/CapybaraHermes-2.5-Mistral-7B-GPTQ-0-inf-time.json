Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\n    A: There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted. So there must have been 21 - 15 = 6. The answer is 6.\n\n    Q: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\n    A: There are originally 3 cars. 2 more cars arrive. 3 + 2 = 5.

How many seashells did Leigh have?<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> assistant\nA: Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells, which is 2 * 12 = 24 seashells. Kyle found twice as many, so he found 24 * 2 = 48 seashells. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, so Leigh has 48 / 3 = 16 seashells. The answer is 16.<|im_end|>",

How many pets does he have in total?<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> assistant\nA: Let's use variables to represent the number of each type of pet:\n\nLet C = number of cats\nLet S = number of snakes\nLet P = number of parrots\n\nWe know that:\n1. S = C + 6 (Frankie has six more snakes than cats)\n2. P = C - 1 (Frankie has one less parrot than cats)\n3. There are 6 pets with four legs, and 2 of them are dogs. So, there are 6 - 2 = 4 pets that are either cats or parrots.\n\nSince the total number of pets is the sum of the number of cats, snakes, parrots, and the two dogs, we can write the equation:\n\nC + S + P + 2 = total number of pets\nC + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2 = total number of pets\n4C + 5 = total number of pets\n\nWe don't have the exact number of cats, but we know that the total number of pets is a multiple of 4, since 4 pets have four legs and are either cats or parrots. So, the total number of pets must be 4, 8, 12, or 16.\n\nIf Frankie has 2 dogs, then he has 14 pets in total (14 is a multiple of 4, and 2 dogs). So, we can use C = 4 (the number of cats) in our equation:\n\n4 + (4 + 6) + (4 - 1) + 2 = 14\n4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19\n\nNow, we can find the number of each type of pet:\n\nC = 4 (cats)\nS = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (snakes)\nP = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 (parrots)\n\nSo, Frankie has 4 cats, 10 snakes, 3 parrots, and 2 dogs, for a total of 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19 pets.<|im_end|>",

Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> assistant\nA: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Olaf initially had 150 toy cars.\n2. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many as Uncle gave.\n3. Dad gave Olaf 10 less than Mum.\n4. Auntie gave Olaf 1 more than Uncle.\n\nLet x be the number of toy cars Uncle gave.\n\nGrandpa gave 2x, Dad gave x - 10, and Auntie gave x + 1.\n\nTotal number of toy cars Olaf has after receiving all these gifts is 150 + (2x + x + x - 10 + x + 1).\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x and then calculate the total number of toy cars.\n\nSince Dad gave 10 less than Mum, we know that x - 10 = x, which means x = 10.\n\nNow, we can plug the value of x into the equation for the total number of toy cars:\n\n150 + (2x + x + x - 10 + x + 1) = 150 + (2*10 + 10 + 10 - 10 + 10 + 1) = 150 + 31 = 181.\n\nSo, Olaf has 181 toy cars in total after receiving all these gifts.<|im_end|>",

At the end of the week, she goes to the bank and asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give her. She leaves the rest in the account. How many dollars remain in the account?<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> assistant\nA: Emma starts with $100. She spends $8 per day for a week, which is 7 days. So, she spends 8 * 7 = $56 during the week. She has $100 - $56 = $44 left in her account. She can get 44 / 5 = 8 $5 bills. The remaining amount in her account is 8 * 5 = $40. The answer is $40.<|im_end|>",

The first day, he covered 10 kilometers of steep mountainside. The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike?<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> assistant\nA: Ezekiel hiked 10 kilometers on the first day. On the second day, he covered half the full hike distance, which is 50 kilometers / 2 = 25 kilometers. So, on the first and second days, he hiked a total of 10 + 25 = 35 kilometers.\n\nSince the total hike distance was 50 kilometers, on the third day, Ezekiel had to hike 50 - 35 = 15 kilometers to finish the hike.

On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than the number he collected on the second day. If he collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, what's the number of tins he collected each day for the rest of the week?<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> assistant\nA: On the first day, James collects 50 tins. On the second day, he collects 3 times that number, which is 50 * 3 = 150 tins. On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than the second day, so he collects 150 - 50 = 100 tins.\n\nNow, let's find out how many tins he has collected in the first three days: 50 + 150 + 100 = 300 tins.\n\nHe has a goal of collecting 500 tins in a week. So, he still needs to collect 500 - 300 = 200 tins for the rest of the week.\n\nSince he collects an equal number of tins each day for the rest of the week, he will collect 200 / 4 = 50 tins per day for the remaining days.

What is the final score from these 3 throws?<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> assistant\nA: Don scores 50 points for the bullseye. The third throw is worth half the points of the bullseye, so it's worth 50 / 2 = 25 points. The third throw scores 25 points.

If he tosses 6 pebbles, 3 rocks, and 2 boulders, what is the total width of the splashes he makes?<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> assistant\nA: First, we need to find the total width of the splashes made by each type of rock.\n\nFor pebbles: 6 pebbles * 1/4 meter per pebble = 6/4 = 1.5 meters\nFor rocks: 3 rocks * 1/2 meter per rock = 3/2 = 1.5 meters\nFor boulders: 2 boulders * 2 meters per boulder = 4 meters\n\nNow, we add the total widths of the splashes together:\n1.5 meters (pebbles) + 1.5 meters (rocks) + 4 meters (boulders) = 7 meters\n\nThe total width of the splashes TreQuan makes is 7 meters.<|im_end|>",
