How many pets does he have in total?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nA: Let's use variables to represent the number of each type of pet. Let x be the number of cats, s be the number of snakes, and p be the number of parrots.\n\nWe know that s = x + 6 (Frankie has six more snakes than cats).\nWe also know that p = x - 1 (Frankie has one less parrot than cats).\n\nWe know that 6 pets have four legs, and these are the cats, snakes, and dogs. So, x + s + 2 (the number of dogs) = 6.\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for x, s, and p from the previous equations into this equation:\n\nx + (x + 6) + 2 = 6\n2x + 6 + 2 = 6\n2x + 8 = 6\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x = 6 - 8\n2x = -2\nx = -1\n\nSince we can't have a negative number of cats, there must be an error in the problem statement. Please check the problem statement and provide the correct information.<|im_end|>",

Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, 1 more than the uncle. How many toy cars does Olaf have in total, after receiving all these gifts?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nA: Let's first find out how many toy cars Grandpa gave Olaf. Since Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many as Uncle, and Uncle gave Olaf 6 toy cars, Grandpa gave Olaf 2 * 6 = 12 toy cars.\n\nNow let's find out how many toy cars Dad gave Olaf. Dad gave Olaf 10 toy cars, 5 less than Mum. So Mum gave Olaf 10 + 5 = 15 toy cars.\n\nNow we know the number of toy cars each family member gave Olaf: Grandpa (12), Dad (10), Mum (15), and Auntie (6).\n\nTo find the total number of toy cars Olaf received, we add all these numbers together: 12 + 10 + 15 + 6 = 43.\n\nSince Olaf initially had 150 toy cars in his collection, after receiving all these gifts, he has a total of 150 + 43 = 193 toy cars. The answer is 193.<|im_end|>",

She leaves the rest in the account. How many dollars remain in the account?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nA: Emma spends $8 per day for a week, which is 7 days. So, she spends 8 * 7 = $56 during the week. Her account balance is $100, so she has $100 - $56 = $44 left in her account. She can get 44 / 5 = 8 $5 bills and will have $4 left in her account. The answer is $4.<|im_end|>",

The first day, he covered 10 kilometers of steep mountainside. The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nA: Ezekiel hiked 10 kilometers on the first day. On the second day, he covered half the full hike distance, which is 50 kilometers / 2 = 25 kilometers. So, on the first and second days combined, he hiked 10 + 25 = 35 kilometers. To finish the hike, he needed to cover the remaining distance, which is 50 kilometers - 35 kilometers = 15 kilometers. The answer is 15.<|im_end|>",

On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than the number he collected on the second day. If he collects an equal number of tins on the remaining days of the week, what's the number of tins he collected each day for the rest of the week?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nA: On the second day, James collects 3 times the number of tins he collected on the first day, which is 3 * 50 = 150 tins. On the third day, he collects 50 tins fewer than the second day, so he collects 150 - 50 = 100 tins.\n\nIn total, for the first three days, James collected 50 (first day) + 150 (second day) + 100 (third day) = 300 tins.\n\nHe has 500 tins to collect in total, so he has 500 - 300 = 200 tins left to collect for the rest of the week.\n\nSince he collects an equal number of tins each day for the remaining days, he will collect 200 / 4 = 50 tins per day for the rest of the week.

What is the final score from these 3 throws?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nA: The bullseye is worth 50 points. The third dart is worth half the points of the bullseye, so it's worth 50 / 2 = 25 points. The second dart received no points. To find the final score, add the points from all three darts: 50 (bullseye) + 0 (missed) + 25 (third dart) = 75 points. The answer is 75.<|im_end|>",

Rocks make a splash that is 1/2 a meter wide, and boulders create a splash that is 2 meters wide. If he tosses 6 pebbles, 3 rocks, and 2 boulders, what is the total width of the splashes he makes?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nA: First, we need to find the total width of the splashes made by each type of rock. For pebbles, it's 1/4 meter per pebble, and he throws 6 pebbles, so the total width for pebbles is 1/4 * 6 = 1.5 meters.\n\nFor rocks, it's 1/2 a meter per rock, and he throws 3 rocks, so the total width for rocks is 1/2 * 3 = 1.5 meters.\n\nFor boulders, it's 2 meters per boulder, and he throws 2 boulders, so the total width for boulders is 2 * 2 = 4 meters.\n\nNow, we add the total widths of the splashes for each type of rock: 1.5 (pebbles) + 1.5 (rocks) + 4 (boulders) = 7 meters.

Each omelet requires 4 eggs, so with all 36 eggs, Pauly can make 36 / 4 = 9 omelets. Since there are 3 people, each person gets 9 / 3 = 3 omelets. The answer is 3.<|im_end|>",

The third stack was 6 blocks shorter than the second stack, and the fourth stack was 10 blocks taller than the third stack. If the fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, how many blocks did Thomas use in all?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nA: The first stack has 7 blocks. The second stack is 3 blocks taller, so it has 7 + 3 = 10 blocks. The third stack is 6 blocks shorter, so it has 10 - 6 = 4 blocks. The fourth stack is 10 blocks taller, so it has 4 + 10 = 14 blocks. The fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, so it has 10 * 2 = 20 blocks. To find the total number of blocks, add all the blocks together: 7 + 10 + 4 + 14 + 20 = 55.
