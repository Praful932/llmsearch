        "A: Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells, which is 2 * 12 = 24 seashells. Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so he found 24 * 2 = 48 seashells. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, so Leigh had 48 / 3 = 16 seashells. The answer is 16.<|im_end|>",
        "A: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Frankie has 6 more snakes than cats. Let's represent the number of cats as C. So, the number of snakes is C + 6.\n2. Frankie has one less parrot than cats. So, the number of parrots is C - 1.\n3. Six of his pets have four legs, which are the dogs.\n4. He has 2 dogs.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of pets:\n\n1. C (cats) + (C + 6) (snakes) + (C - 1) (parrots) + 2 (dogs) + 6 (four-legged pets)\n2. C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 6 + 2\n3. 4C + 5\n\nSince we know that Frankie has 2 dogs, we can substitute 2 for 6 in the equation:\n\n4C + 5 = total number of pets\n4C + 5 = C + 6 + (C - 1) + 2\n\nNow, let's solve for C:\n\n4C + 5 = 2C + 5 + C + 6 + 2\n4C - 2C = 13\n2C = 13\nC = 13/2\nC = 6.5\n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a pet, we made an assumption that not all pets were accounted for in the given information. In this case, we can conclude that Frankie has at least 6 cats, which means he has 6 + 6 = 12 pets in total (6 snakes and 1 parrot). But remember, this is a minimum number, and there could be more pets. The answer is at least 12.<|im_end|>",
        "A: Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Olaf initially had 150 toy cars.\n2. Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many as Uncle, so Grandpa gave 2 * Uncle's cars.\n3. Dad gave Olaf 10 cars, 5 less than Mum, so Mum gave Olaf 10 + 5 = 15 cars.\n4. Auntie gave Olaf 6 cars, 1 more than Uncle, so Uncle gave Olaf 6 - 1 = 5 cars.\n\nNow let's calculate how many cars each family member gave:\n\n- Grandpa: 2 * Uncle's cars\n- Dad: 10 cars\n- Mum: 15 cars\n- Auntie: 6 cars\n\nUncle's cars = 5 cars (as mentioned in the question)\n\nSo, Grandpa gave 2 * 5 = 10 cars.\n\nNow let's add all the cars given by the family members:\n\n10 (Grandpa) + 10 (Dad) + 15 (Mum) + 6 (Auntie) = 41 cars\n\nFinally, let's add the initial 150 cars to the 41 cars given by the family members:\n\n150 (initial) + 41 (from family) = 191 cars\n\nThe answer is 191.<|im_end|>",

She asks for as many $5 bills as her account can give her, which is $44 / $5 = 8 $5 bills. So she takes out 8 * $5 = $40 from her account. She leaves the remaining $44 - $40 = $4 in her account.

        "A: First, we need to find the total width of the splashes made by each type of rock.\n\nFor pebbles, there are 6 pebbles and each pebble makes a splash 1/4 meter wide. So, the total width of the pebble splashes is 6 * (1/4) = 6/4 = 1.5 meters.\n\nFor rocks, there are 3 rocks and each rock makes a splash 1/2 meter wide. So, the total width of the rock splashes is 3 * (1/2) = 3/2 = 1.5 meters.\n\nFor boulders, there are 2 boulders and each boulder makes a splash 2 meters wide. So, the total width of the boulder splashes is 2 * 2 = 4 meters.\n\nNow, we add up the total width of all the splashes: 1.5 (pebbles) + 1.5 (rocks) + 4 (boulders) = 1.5 + 1.5 + 4 = 7 meters.\n\nThe answer is 7.<|im_end|>",

Since it takes 2 minutes per gate and there are 4 gates, it takes 2 * 4 = 8 minutes to go through all the gates.\n\nNow, we need to convert the time spent at the gates to seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, it takes 8 * 60 = 480 seconds at the gates.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive between floors. Since there are 12 floors and each floor is 800 feet away, the total distance to drive is 12 * 800 = 9600 feet.

The total number of cans is 24 (cherry sodas + orange pop). So, we have the equation: x + (number of cherry sodas) = 24.\n\nSubstitute x = 2 * (number of cherry sodas) into the equation: 2 * (number of cherry sodas) + (number of cherry sodas) = 24.\n\nCombine the terms: 3 * (number of cherry sodas) = 24.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3: (number of cherry sodas) = 24 / 3.\n\nThe number of cherry sodas is 8.

To find the time (x) in minutes, we can divide both sides by 20: x = 220/20 = 11 minutes.\n\nNow, Tom goes up the stairs 5 steps per minute more than Matt, so he goes up 20 + 5 = 25 steps per minute. After 11 minutes, Tom will have gone up 25 * 11 = 275 steps. The answer is 275.<|im_end|>",

        "A: Let x be the time Dad took to vacuum downstairs. Then, twice that amount plus 5 more is the time he took to vacuum upstairs, so it's 2x + 5. The total time for both tasks is 38 minutes, so we can write the equation x + (2x + 5) = 38. Combining the terms, we get 3x + 5 = 38. Subtract 5 from both sides to find 3x = 33. Then, divide by 3 to get x = 11. Dad took 11 minutes to vacuum downstairs. To find the time he took to vacuum upstairs, plug x back into the equation: 2x + 5 = 2(11) + 5 = 22 + 5 = 27.
