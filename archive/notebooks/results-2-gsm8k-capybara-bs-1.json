The total time he spent vacuuming is x + (2x + 5) = 38 minutes.\n\nCombining the terms, we get the equation 3x + 5 = 38. Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 3x = 33.

        "A: First, we need to find out how far the Skipper sailed eastwards: 20 hours * 30 km/h = 600 km. Since he sailed halfway to the destination, that means he had traveled 600 km / 2 = 300 km towards the destination.\n\nWhen the engines were turned off, the ship was blown backward in a westward direction. Since the Skipper was only one-third of the way to the destination after the storm, that means the ship was 300 km / 3 = 100 km away from the destination.\n\nSo, the ship was blown 300 km (original progress towards the destination) - 100 km (progress after the storm) = 200 km westward by the storm.
